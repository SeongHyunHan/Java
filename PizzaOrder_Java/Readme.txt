Pizza Order Project

Created by Seong Hyun Han

Worked in NETBEAN with Java FX Scene Builder 2.0.

When program runs it start from Log-in page asked Employee's to sign-in

after empolyee logged-in then the customer window shows up.

on the customer information, all input field are disabled until order option has selected.

if pick-up option is selected then it make Name and Phone as required field and address and email field are optional.

if delivery option is selected then it make Name, Phone, and address as requried and email as optional field.

when click start order it check for the validation if one of required field is empty then the field box color turns into red.

if validation is true then it goes to pizza order window and generate 3 random number for the order number.

pizza order window, and sidedish and drink window both have order button. and these two windows can go back and forth.

if no pizza or no sidedish or no drink order are place it will not go through order button.

when adding an order it will hold value in order.java file until user press the order button.

once they place the order then it will generate the receipt.

receipt will be stored in Receipt folder with name ORDERXXX.txt (XXX = 3 randomly generate numbers).
